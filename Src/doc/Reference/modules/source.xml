        A configuration template for tests, hibernate.cfg.xml.template, can be found
		in the root folder of the tests. Copy this file and rename it to hibernate.cfg.xml
		and point to a database of your choice.

        The test data is in most cases created in the "initialize" method (which is called once before
        the tests from this class are executed), which normally creates a couple of revisions,
        by persisting and updating entities. The tests first check if the revisions, in which
        entities where modified are correct (the testRevisionCounts method), and if the historic
        data is correct (the testHistoryOfXxx methods).
