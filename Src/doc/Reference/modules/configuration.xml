		<para>
			To start working with Envers, all configuration needed is to call
			the extension method IntegrateWithEnvers() on the NH Configuration object,
			as described in the <xref linkend="quickstart"/>.
		</para>

		<para>
			However, as Envers generates some entities and maps them to tables, it is possible to set the prefix and suffix
			that is added to the entity name to create an audit table for an entity, as well
			as set the names of the fields that are generated.

		<title>Choosing an audit strategy</title>

		<para>
			After the basic configuration it is important to choose the audit strategy that will be used to persist and
			retrieve audit information. There is a trade-off between the performance of persisting and the performance
			of querying the audit information. Currently there two audit strategies:

			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The default audit strategy persists the audit data together with a start revision. For each row
						inserted, updated or deleted in an audited table, one or more rows are inserted in the audit tables,
						together with the start revision of its validity. Rows in the audit tables are never updated after insertion.
						Queries of audit information use subqueries to select the applicable rows in the audit tables.
						These subqueries are notoriously slow and difficult to index.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The alternative is a validity audit strategy. This strategy stores the start-revision and the end-revision
						of audit information. For each row inserted, updated or deleted in an audited table, one or more rows
						are inserted in the audit tables, together with the start revision of its validity. But at the same time
						the end-revision field of the previous audit rows (if available) are set to this revision.
						Queries on the audit information can then use 'between start and end revision' instead of subqueries
						as used by the default audit strategy.
						The consequence of this strategy is that persisting audit information will be a bit slower, because of the
						extra updates involved, but retrieving audit information will be a lot faster. This can be improved by
						adding extra indexes.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>

		<para>
			There are three ways setting property values. All examples below produce the same result
			(tells Envers to store entity data at delete).
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[//NHibernate Core syntax
nhConf.SetProperty("nhibernate.envers.store_data_at_delete", "true");

//Using SetEnversProperty extension method with type safe value input
nhConf.SetEnversProperty(ConfigurationKey.StoreDataAtDelete, true);

//Using ConfigurationKey directly with type safe value input

			In more detail, below are the properties that you can pass to NHibernate.Cfg.Configuration.
			The property names are, from code, also available on ConfigurationKey class.

		<title>Additional mapping annotations</title>

		<para>
			To set the value of any of the properties described above, simply add an entry to
			your NHibernate Core's <literal>Configuration</literal> object.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			To change the name of the revision table and its fields (the table, in which the
			numbers of revisions and their timestamps are stored), you can use the
			<literal>[RevisionEntity]</literal> attribute.
			For more information, see <xref linkend="revisionlog"/>.
		</para>

		<para>
			The name of the audit table can be set on a per-entity basis, using the <literal>AuditTableAttribute</literal> (attribute) or <literal>SetTableInfo()</literal> (fluent).
			It may be tedious to add this annotation to every audited entity, so if possible, it's better to use a prefix/suffix.
			As an alternative, you can create your own <literal>nhibernate.envers.table_name_strategy</literal> to set table names.
		</para>

		<para>
			If you have a mapping with join tables, audit tables for them will be generated in
			the same way (by adding the prefix and suffix). If you wish to overwrite this behaviour,
			you can use the <literal>[JoinAuditTable]</literal> attribute.
		</para>

		<para>
			If you'd like to override auditing behaviour of some fields/properties inherited from
			a non mapped base type or in an embedded component, you can apply the <literal>[AuditOverride]</literal> 
			attribute on the subtype or usage site of the component.
		</para>

		<para>
			If you want to audit a relation, where the target entity is not audited (that is the case for example with
			dictionary-like entities, which don't change and don't have to be audited), just annotate it with
			<literal>[Audited(targetAuditMode = RelationTargetAuditMode.NOT_AUDITED]</literal>
			(or use fluent configuration: <literal>ExcludeRelationData()</literal>). Then, when reading historic
			versions of your entity, the relation will always point to the "current" related entity.
			By default Envers throws  when "current" entity does not exist in the database. 
			Apply <literal>not-found="ignore"</literal> in your mapping
			to silence the exception and assign null value instead. Hereby solution causes implicit eager loading
			of to-one relations.
		</para>

		<para>
			If you'd like to audit properties of a superclass of an entity, which are not explicitly audited (which
			don't have the <literal>AuditedAttribute</literal> on any properties or on the class),
			use <literal>[AuditOverride(ForClass = typeof(SomeEntity), IsAudited = true/false)]</literal>.
		</para>

		<para>
			If an audited entity should be created by a factory, annotate the entity with the <literal>[AuditFactory(typeof(SomeFactory))]</literal>
			attribute to specify the factory type.  You can also pass an pre-configured instance into the fluent interface's <literal>UseFactory()</literal>.
