		Working with object-oriented software and a relational database can be cumbersome
		and time consuming in today's enterprise environments. NHibernate is an object/relational
		mapping tool for .NET environments. The term object/relational mapping (ORM) refers to
		the technique of mapping a data representation from an object model to a relational
		data model with a SQL-based schema.

		NHibernate not only takes care of the mapping from .NET classes to
		database tables (and from .NET data types to SQL data types), but also provides data
		query and retrieval facilities and can significantly reduce development time otherwise
		spent with manual data handling in SQL and ADO.NET.

		NHibernate's goal is to relieve the developer from 95 percent of common data persistence
		related programming tasks. NHibernate may not be the best solution for data-centric
		applications that only use stored-procedures to implement the business logic in the
		database, it is most useful with object-oriented domain models and business logic in
		the .NET-based middle-tier. However, NHibernate can certainly help you to remove or
		encapsulate vendor-specific SQL code and will help with the common task of result set
		translation from a tabular representation to a graph of objects.
