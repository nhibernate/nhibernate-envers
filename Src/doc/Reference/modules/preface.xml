		The Envers project aims to enable easy auditing of persistent classes. All that you
		have to do is to configure Envers to audit some of your persistent classes.
		For each audited entity, a table will be created which will hold the history of changes made to the entity. You
		can then retrieve and query historical data without much effort.
	</para>

		Similarly to source control systems, the library has a concept of revisions. Basically, one
		transaction is one revision (unless the transaction didn't modify any audited entities).
		As the revisions are global and having a revision number, you can query for various
		entities at that revision, retrieving a (partial) view of the database at that
		revision. You can find a revision number having a date, and the other way round,
		you can get the date at which a revision was commited.

		The library works with NHibernate version 3.1 or later.
		For the auditing to work properly, the entities must have immutable unique
		identifiers (primary keys).
