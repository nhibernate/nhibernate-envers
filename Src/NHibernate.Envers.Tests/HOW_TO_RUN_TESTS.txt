1. Build NHibernate.Envers.Test
2. Modify hibernate.cfg.xml to point to your database (if there's been modification of hibernate.cfg.xml.template after you pulled latest, your hibernate.cfg.xml need to reflect these changes)
3. Run the tests


NHibernate Envers' tests are using Parameterized Test Fixtures
http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=testFixture&r=2.6
to run (most) integration tests twice, once for DefaultAuditStrategy and once for ValidityAuditStrategy.
Make sure you have a modern test runner!
