Some notes...

* Most of Envers functionality is ported, you can read manual here... 
http://docs.jboss.org/envers/docs/index.html. 
There's a short cut for configuration though - simply call IntegrateWithEnvers on your NH Configuration object.

* There's some experimental support for programmatic configuration.
Have a look at FluentConfiguration

* Send user questions to NH user group list, http://groups.google.com/group/nhusers?pli=1

* Report bugs and/or patches with unit tests here http://216.121.112.228/browse/NHE    

* Binaries are available here, http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhcontrib/files/
